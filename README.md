## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


### **Welcome to my readME!** 

Like an ill-thought out project that you've neglected for a few months, here are my tech-specs:

- Currently a student at Varsity College, Cape Town
- I'm studying **Application Development**, and I have my eye on a post-grad **data science** program
- I'm my class's representative
- I go out of my way to provide well commented examples to my classmates after each programming exercise
- I am proficient in Java, R, and SQL
- I'm dabbling in Python, PHP, and (unironically) Inform7
- I will someday be forced to learn C, and I will be kicking and screaming the whole way there
- I code in my off time, and have been working on a rather regex-heavy mess I gratuitously call an 'app' for 4 months now
- HTML can't be parsed by regex.
- Don't do it

My interests that I actually talk about when around human beings:

 - Chess
 - Dungeons & Dragons
 - Geopolitics
 - Books
 - I said books but I actually meant fan-fictions
 - Yes, there's a difference
 - (trust me)
 - Vexillology
 - History
 - Urban planning, design, and implementations
 - Some Netflix series you've never heard of that got cancelled after the first season
