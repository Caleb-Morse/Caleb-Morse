# Welcome to my readME!

Like an overgrown personal project you swore you'd clean up this weekend, here are my current tech-specs:

🎓 Former student of both Stellenbosch University and Varsity College Cape Town  
💼 Completed a year-long internship as a Data Scientist at Mr Price Group  
🚀 **Starting January 2026:** Graduate Programme Software Developer at **Open Box**  
🛠 Interested in software development, enterprise solutions, and data science  
🤝 I’ve worked on live projects, collaborated with teams, and met real deadlines  
🧪 I specialise in building things that are complex, maybe overengineered, but *mine*

🧠 Proficient in C#/.NET, SQL, Java, and R
💡 I dabble in Python, CSS/HTML/JS, and TypeScript  
💢 I will someday be forced to learn C, and I will be kicking and screaming the entire way  
📎 I also code in my free time, and have been knee-deep in regex-heavy nightmares I lovingly call “tools” for modding various games

Work, questions, or philosophical debates welcome.

## My interests I actually talk about around human beings:

- ♟ Chess (poorly, enthusiastically)  
- 🎲 Dungeons & Dragons  
- 🗺 Geopolitics  
- 📚 Books  
- ✍️ Fan-fiction (yes, it counts. yes, there’s a difference. *trust me*)  
- 🇿🇦 Vexillology  
- 🗺 Maps, of all kinds  
- 📖 History — especially obscure, ironic, or doomed military campaigns  
- 🏙 Urban planning and infrastructure design  
- 📺 Some show you’ve never heard of that got cancelled after season 1

HTML cannot be parsed with regex.  
Ever.  
Don’t do it.  
This is your warning.
