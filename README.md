# Welcome to my readME!

Like an overgrown personal project you swore you'd clean up this weekend, here are my current tech-specs:

🎓 Former student at Stellenbosch University, now studying Application Development at Varsity College, Cape Town  
💼 Completed a year-long internship as a Data Scientist at Mr Price Group  
🛠 Seeking work in software development or data science. Part-time, full-time, remote, on-site; I’m open  
🤝 I’ve worked on live projects, collaborated with teams, and met real deadlines  
🧪 I specialise in building things that are complex, maybe overengineered, but *mine*

🧠 I’m proficient in Java, R, SQL, and C#  
💡 I dabble in Python, CSS/HTML/JS, Razor, and (still unironically) Inform7  
💢 I will someday be forced to learn C, and I will be kicking and screaming the entire way  
📎 I also code in my free time, and have been knee-deep in a regex-heavy nightmare I lovingly call a “tool” for modding Hearts of Iron IV

✉️ Email me at caleb.gemorse@gmail.com. Work, questions, or philosophical debates welcome.

## My interests I actually talk about when around human beings:

- ♟ Chess (poorly, enthusiastically)
- 🎲 Dungeons & Dragons
- 🗺 Geopolitics
- 📚 Books  
- ✍️ Fan-fiction (yes, it counts. yes, there’s a difference. *trust me*)
- 🏴 Vexillology
- 📖 History (especially obscure, ironic, or doomed military campaigns)
- 🏙 Urban planning and infrastructure design
- 📺 Some show you’ve never heard of that got cancelled after season 1

HTML cannot be parsed with regex.  
Ever.  
Don’t do it.  
This is your warning.
